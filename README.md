This makes it an ideal project for beginners to learn about client-side web development and form handling.

Features 🔥

Validation: Ensures all fields are filled out and passwords match during signup.

Local Storage Integration: Stores user credentials in localStorage for simplicity.

Dynamic Navigation: Users can toggle between signup and login pages seamlessly.

Interactive Buttons: Hover effects on buttons enhance user experience.

Files Included 📂

index.html: Contains the structure of the application.

style.css: Provides styling for the application, ensuring an attractive and interactive design.

script.js: Contains the logic for form handling and local storage management.

How It Works ✨

Signup Flow 🔑

User fills out the Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password fields.

The system validates:

All fields are filled.

Password and Confirm Password match.

If the user is already registered (email exists in localStorage), they are alerted.

On successful signup, the user is redirected to the login page.

Login Flow ➡

User enters their Email and Password.

The system checks if the credentials match the stored values in localStorage.

If successful, a success message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message prompts the user to try again.
